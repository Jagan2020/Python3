How many 2s do we multiply to get 8?
        (OR)
How many 2s need to get 8?

Answer: 2 × 2 × 2 = 8, so we had to multiply 3 of the 2s to get 8
So the logarithm is 3

How to Write it
We write "the number of 2s we need to multiply to get 8 is 3" as:
log2(8) = 3

The number we multiply is called the "base",	
so we can say:
"the logarithm of 8 with base 2 is 3"

Notice we are dealing with three numbers:
1. the base: the number we are multiplying (a "2" in the example above)
2. how often to use it in a multiplication (3 times, which is the logarithm)
3. The number we want to get (an "8")

Example: What is log5(625) ... ?
how many 5s need to be multiplied together to get 625?
5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 625, so we need 4 of the 5s
Answer: log5(625) = 4

#### Natural Logarithms: Base "e" ###

Natural Logarithms Base is "e" (Euler's Number)
Another base that is often used is e (Euler's Number) which is about 2.71828.

This is called a "natural logarithm". Mathematicians use this one a lot.

It is how many times "e"s need to be multiplied, to get our desired number.
Example: ln(7.389) = loge(7.389) ≈ 2
Because 2.71828**2 ≈ 7.389

Example:
np.exp([3])
Out:
array([20.08553692])

2.7182818**3
Out:
20.085536292331234
