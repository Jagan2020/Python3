Maximum Subarray Problem:
Simple idea of the Kadane's algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array.

The maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the largest possible sum of a contiguous subarray, 
within a given one-dimensional array A[1â€¦n] of numbers.

-2 1 - 3 4 -1 2 1 -5 4

For example, for the array given above, the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is [4, -1, 2, 1], with sum 6.
