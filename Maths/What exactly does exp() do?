The exponential function is e^x where e is a mathematical constant called Euler's number, approximately 2.718281. 
This value has a close mathematical relationship with pi and the slope of the curve e^x is equal to its value at every point. 
exp() calculates e^x for each value of x in your input array.

Euler's number is 2.718281.
exp(x) = e^x where e= 2.718281(approx)

Ex:
2.7182818**3
Out:
20.085536292331234
